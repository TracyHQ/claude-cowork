/* wp-ja-kinetic: the dark mode switch.
 *
 * Two states — light and dark — kept for a year in the `tracy_theme` cookie, both written to
 * `data-theme` on the root element. There is no `auto` state: the Joomla source this theme is
 * carried from resolves its theme server-side from `window.jaKineticTheme.def` and its own
 * toggle() is a two-way flip, so no visitor of the original can reach a third state. The
 * default is the page's own, as it is there: dark, except on the Blueprint page (light).
 *
 * This file is enqueued in the head, blocking, so the attribute is on the root before the first
 * paint; the toggle buttons ([data-tracy-theme-toggle]) are wired once the document has parsed.
 * Each click flips light ⇄ dark.
 *
 * The source's own button carries a STATIC accessible name and a hard-coded `aria-pressed=
 * "false"` regardless of which theme is actually resolved (measured live on both light and the
 * dark default: `aria-label="Toggle dark mode" aria-pressed="false"`) — the markup
 * (parts/header.html) already carries both, so this file only ever flips the root itself: the
 * `data-theme` attribute, which the dark palette (theme.overlay.json) and the sun/moon icon swap
 * in assets/css/wp-ja-kinetic.css read, and the `t4-dark` class, which the source's own apply()
 * sets alongside it and which the rules carried over in assets/css/wp-ja-kinetic-sections.css
 * still key on. */
