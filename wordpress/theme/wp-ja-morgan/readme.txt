JA Morgan: the JoomlArt Morgan business design as a WordPress block theme, carried from its Joomla 6 (T3) quickstart.

== Description ==

JA Morgan is the Morgan business-consulting site packaged as a block theme, ported from the JoomlArt JA Morgan Joomla 6 quickstart (T3 framework) so that it renders the same pages. Every section of the site is a block pattern the Site Editor can edit, the look is measured on the running source and carried by theme.json and the theme stylesheet, the header carries the main menu, a search, a light / dark / automatic switch that follows the operating system until the visitor chooses, and the red button that opens the "Joomla Pages" sidebar.

The quick contact form of the home page draws the source's fields; WordPress core sends no mail, so it needs a form plugin to deliver messages.

This theme is not intended for the wordpress.org directory: it bundles patterns for a specific site. It does not update itself; a newer version is installed by uploading its zip.

== Changelog ==

= 1.1.14 =
* No change to the theme's behaviour or look: this release carries the 1.1.13 entry below, which the 1.1.13
  package shipped without.

= 1.1.13 =
* The theme's own stylesheet reads its palette through the design-system slot: each palette colour is
  var(--ds-c-<role>, <that colour>), undefined until a design system is worn, so the theme looks exactly as before.

= 1.1.12 =
* The home style 4 footer's copyright column names the site instead of "© 2019 Morgan … Made by Morgan". Not
  released on its own: ships with the next quickstart/ja-morgan/wp7 cut.

= 1.1.11 =
* The header shows the site's logo, or its name in Morgan's text style; the copyright lines name the site.
