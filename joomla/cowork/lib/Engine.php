/**
 * Engine — turns one HTTP call into one bounded piece of work and answers with a plain array.
 *
 * The guiding split is that this side stays simple and the caller stays clever. The engine holds
 * no loop and remembers nothing between calls: check the token, route the action, do at most one
 * chunk, return the result and where to carry on from. The caller keeps the cursor and comes
 * back. That is what lets an arbitrarily large site finish on a host that stops PHP after thirty
 * seconds, and it is why nothing here has to be restarted from the beginning when a request dies.
 *
 * Failures come back as {ok:false, error} rather than an HTTP 500, so a caller can tell a wrong
 * token from a missing table and retry only what is worth retrying.
 *
 * No Joomla dependency: the component wires the real implementations in, and the tests wire
 * fakes, which is why the whole engine can be exercised without a web server or a database.
