# Tracy Claude Cowork — Joomla

A Joomla component that lets Tracy read a site — its database and its files — over one
token-authenticated endpoint, and install an extension onto it.

```
index.php?option=com_claudecowork&task=api.exec&format=json
```

Everything is read-only except `extension.install`, which takes one `https` `.zip` URL the site
downloads itself and hands to Joomla's own installer. There is no uninstall, no file write and
no way to name a local path: a caller holding the token can add to a site, never quietly remove
from it. `extension.list` reports what is already there, so a caller can tell "already
installed" from "installed in another version" without guessing.

## Layout

| Path | What |
| --- | --- |
| `lib/` | The engine. **No Joomla dependency**, unit tested on its own (`tests/run.php`). |
| `com_claudecowork/site/` | The endpoint: one thin controller that hands a request to the engine. |
| `com_claudecowork/administrator/` | Enough for Joomla to install it and show its Options, where the token is set. |
| `pkg_claudecowork.xml` | Package wrapper. |

`lib/` at the repo root is the source of truth; `build.sh` copies it into the component. Never
edit the copy — that is how the two silently diverge.

## Build and test

```bash
./build.sh                                    # → dist/pkg_claudecowork.zip
docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/w -w /w php:8.3-cli php tests/run.php
```

## Why a component, not a plugin

This started as `plg_ajax_tracymigration`, reached through `com_ajax`. That works, but
`com_ajax` only exists from **Joomla 3.2** — verified against the Joomla repository: absent at
tags 2.5.0, 3.0.0 and 3.1.5, present at 3.2.0 — so it cannot cover the generations

commits to. `index.php?option=com_x&task=y` is Joomla's oldest routing contract and is stable
from 1.5 through 6. A component needs nobody's permission for an entry point; `com_ajax`
exists precisely to lend one to plugins, which have none of their own.

A component also has somewhere to grow: its own admin screens, ACL and tables, none of which
a plugin can hold.

## Design

The engine does **one bounded piece of work per call** and returns a cursor; the caller keeps
the cursor and loops. Shared hosting kills PHP at `max_execution_time`, so anything that
cannot resume never finishes on a large site.

The component never holds object-storage credentials. For uploads it receives a presigned URL
good for exactly one part.

Procedure, traps and the plugin contract:
the internal migration notes.
